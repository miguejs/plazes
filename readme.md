## CSS Guidelines
## CSS Arquitecture
* We are using SMACSS as the default arquitecture

### Formatting

* Use soft tabs (2 spaces) for indentation

* Do not use ID selectors
* When using multiple selectors in a rule declaration, give each selector its own line.
* Put a space before the opening brace `{` in rule declarations
* In properties, put a space after, but not before, the `:` character.
* Put closing braces `}` of rule declarations on a new line
* Put blank lines between rule declarations

### Comments

* Prefer line comments (`//`) to block comments.
* Prefer comments on their own line. Avoid end-of-line comments.
* Write detailed comments for code that isn't self-documenting:
  - Uses of z-index
  - Compatibility or browser-specific hacks
